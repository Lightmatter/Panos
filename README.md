# Code Review

## Overview
This is a simple TODO making app implemented with a React/NextJS frontend and a Django backend. We use Django Rest Framework to create and serve our API endpoints. We are using django-filters which has a DRF integration to help us with searching existing TODOs. All TODOs are stored in the database (postgres) so they persist over time.

This is the base version of the frontend.
